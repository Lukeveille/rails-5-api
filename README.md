# README

## Get started!

To start your new Rails app, run the following command:
```
rails new rails-girls --api
```

Rails will create all the files you need, and install any necessary gems (dependencies).
```
Bundle complete! 9 Gemfile dependencies, 53 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
         run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
* bin/rake: spring inserted
* bin/rails: spring inserted
```

Scaffold your first model and its corresponding controller and routes:
```
bin/rails generate scaffold Neighbourhood name:string num_businesses:integer home_price:decimal
```

Rails will create a database migration, a model, tests for the model, new routes, a controller
a controller for the model, and tests for the controller.
```
      invoke  active_record
      create    db/migrate/20181101224205_create_neighbourhoods.rb
      create    app/models/neighbourhood.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/models/neighbourhood_test.rb
      create      test/fixtures/neighbourhoods.yml
      invoke  resource_route
       route    resources :neighbourhoods
      invoke  scaffold_controller
      create    app/controllers/neighbourhoods_controller.rb
      invoke    test_unit
      create      test/controllers/neighbourhoods_controller_test.rb
```

### Add the table to the database

Let's look at the new database migration generated by Rails:
```ruby
class CreateNeighbourhoods < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]
  def change
    create_table :neighbourhoods do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :num_businesses
      t.decimal :home_price

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

You'll need to run the data migration:
```
bin/rails db:migrate
```

Rails will create the Neighbourhoods table in the database.
```
