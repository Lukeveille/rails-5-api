## Get started!

To start your new Rails app, run the following command:
```
rails new rails-girls --api
```

Rails will create all the files you need, and install any necessary gems (dependencies).
```
Bundle complete! 9 Gemfile dependencies, 53 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
         run  bundle exec spring binstub --all
* bin/rake: spring inserted
* bin/rails: spring inserted
```
